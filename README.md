### Hi there, I'm Jackie ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! âœ¨

Here is a little bit about me and what I do:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building ios apps with Swift.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in Swift. 

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with just about anything with my current repositories. I have been cleaning up as I go and attempting to fix bugs, update the repos, and just overall how to do better in my code. I take constructive criticism well so shoot! 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my repositories!
