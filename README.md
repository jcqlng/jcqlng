### Hi there, I'm Jackie 👋

✨ Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! ✨

  * 👩‍💻I am a legal secreatry in criminal defense in South Florida. 
  * 👩‍💻I started to gain interest and the courage to learn about full stack web development since March of 2020.  
  * 👩‍💻I have a true love and passion for technology. I was looking for a true challenge. 
  * 👩‍💻I feel creating/designing websites and applications are so much fun and rewarding to the mind. 

I specialize in:
  *💫	HTML 
  *💫	CSS
  *💫	Javascript
  *💫	React JS
  *💫	Node Js
  *💫	MySQL 
  *💫	Mongo DB
  
What I enjoy to do in my spare time is the following: 
  * 🏃‍♀️ Exercising (mostly walking and light jogs)
  * 🐕 Spending time with my pets. I have dogs, cats, chickens, a pig, and birds so they keep me entertained. 
  * 🎣 Fishing as it is a Florida thing.
  * 📖 Reading as I like to exercise the mind and read some great articles from fellow tech friends through Medium and DEV.
