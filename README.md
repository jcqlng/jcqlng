### Hi there, I'm Jackie ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! âœ¨

Here is a little bit about me and what I do:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on React Apps at the moment.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full stack web development. So far I learned briefly about HTML, CSS, JS, Node, MySQL, API's, MongoDB, and React. 

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with just about anything with my current repositories. I have been cleaning up as I go and attempting to fix bugs, update the repos, and just overall how to do better in my code. I take constructive criticism well so shoot! 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my repositories!
