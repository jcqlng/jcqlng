### Hi there, I'm Jackie ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! âœ¨

Here is a little bit about me and what I do:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on on a gorup project called Pet Paw-tners which helps you find a pet sitter and help those who pet sit for a living find their "match" based a survey taken. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full stack web development. So far I learned briefly about HTML, CSS, JS, Node, MySQL, and API's. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a database for auto auctions. I currently am the executive assistant to Rupp auctions and feel that our database can be efficient.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with just about anything with my current repositories. I have been cleaning up as I go and attempting to fix bugs, update the repos, and just overall how to do better in my code. I take constructive criticism well so shoot! 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about repositories! I would like to get comfortable in speaking / typing the code lingo!
